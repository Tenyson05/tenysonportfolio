			<p>
			Final year university student studying computer science at the University Of Technology, Jamaica and an aspiring 
			cybersecurity analyst/engineer. I enjoy being a developer and a cybersecurity enthusiast which allows me to build
			applications, software or websites with the added benefit of keeping them secure and safe from vulnerabilities 
			and threats. During my spare time, I enjoy coding, watching anime and playing videos. My final goal is to become 
			a game developer and develop a virtual world that grants users total control over their environment.
